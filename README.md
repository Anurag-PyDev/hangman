# hangman

This is a simple project, hangman game.
I have two versions of it in this repository.
1)'hangmanmain.py' is just a single file in which the hangman game is played in text based interface.
2)GUI : The res folder and the main.py file are a part of the GUI based hangman game.The res folder contains the required audio and image files for the game to function properly.

Dependencies:
â€¢ Must have 'pygame' module installed.
(Type 'pip install pygame' in command line to install pygame' module.)
